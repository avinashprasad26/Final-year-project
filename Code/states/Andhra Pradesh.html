  <p><strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong> is a state in southern India. Amaravati is the capital city. It is bounded to the north-west by Telangana, to the north by Chhattisgarh, to the north-east by Odisha, to the south by Tamil Nadu, to the west by Karnataka, and to the east by the Bay of Bengal. It has the second longest coastline in India, after Gujarat, at approximately 974 kilometres. </p>
<br>
<p>With 18.25 million visitors per year, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati is one of the world's most visited religious sites. Â Other pilgrimage sites in the region include the Pancharama Kshetras, Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga, and Kodanda Rama Temple. The beaches of Visakhapatnam, hill stations such as Araku Valley and Horsley Hills, and the deltas of Konaseema in the Godavari and Diviseema in the Krishna rivers are among the state's natural attractions. As of 2022, the state of Andhra Pradesh is divided into 26 districts.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="art">1. Kalamkari is a type of hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile made in Isfahan, Iran, and Andhra Pradesh, India. Kalamkari is a twenty-three-step process that uses only natural dyes. In India, there are two distinct styles of Kalamkari art: the Srikalahasti style and the Machilipatnam style. The Srikalahasti style of Kalamkari is entirely hand worked, with the "kalam" or pen used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colours. This style flourished in temples centred on creating distinct religious identities, appearing on scrolls, temple hangings, chariot banners, and depictions of Hindu deities and scenes (e.g. Ramayana, Mahabharata and Purana). Chitrakars were musicians and painters who travelled from village to village telling Hindu mythology stories to the locals. They illustrated their accounts with large bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple tools and plant dyes. Similar to Buddhist Thangka paintings, those found in Hindu temples are large panels of Kalamkari depicting episodes of Hindu mythology and iconography. Kalamkari art has been practised by many families in Andhra Pradesh and some villages in Tamil Nadu (Sikkalnayakanpettai) by migrants from Telugu speaking families for generations. Kalamkari experienced a period of decline before being resurrected in India and abroad for its craftsmanship. The decorative element for clothing has been popular in the United Kingdom since the 18th century. In the Middle Ages, the term was also used to describe the production of any cotton fabric patterned with vegetable dyes by free-hand and block-printing in many regions of India. The kalam (pen) is used in places where the fabric is block printed to draw finer details and to apply some colours. Traditional techniques have given way to digital techniques in modern times. New techniques are being introduced in this era, and digital files of Kalamkari have been widely distributed throughout India and Iran.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">2. Kondapalli Toys are wooden toys made in Kondapalli of Krishna district, which is close to Vijayawada in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The craft of making things is a 400-year-old tradition. Aryakhastriyas (also known as Nakarshalu) are the artisans who make the toys, and they are mentioned in the Brahmanda Purana. They are said to have migrated from Rajasthan to Kondappali in the 16th century and attribute their origins to Muktharishi, a sage endowed with arts and crafts skills by Lord Shiva. The Kondapalli toys are made from Tella Poniki, a soft wood found in the nearby Kondapalli Hills. Each component is carved separately. The toys are then finished with makku, which is a paste made of tamarind seed powder and sawdust. Depending on the type of toy, the next step is to colour it with oil and water colours or vegetable dyes and enamel paints. The artisans primarily create figures of mythology, animals, birds, bullock carts, rural life, and so on, the most notable of which is Dasavataram, dancing dolls, and so on. The art form that received patronage from rulers in ancient times is in decline due to a lack of profits, the time required to produce toys, the influence of western art, and younger generations who are not encouraged to pursue this art. Lepakshi and the Lanco Institute of General Humanitarian Trust took the initiative to preserve the art of toy making. According to the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act of 1999, it was registered as a geographical indication handicraft from Andhra Pradesh.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">3. Banjara needle craft is a type of needlework that is done with needles. The craft has evolved over time and through generations. It's an embroidered tapestry with mirror work. The artwork is brightly coloured. It requires a high level of trade skill and the use of simple needles, embroidery thread, and unique fabrics (cotton or woollen). They make fantastic works of art when put together. Needlework is the mainstay of this trade, and geometric shapes such as squares, tracings, and diamonds are frequently used patterns. The use of colourful threads on the base cloth, as well as tiny mirrors, beads, and cowrie shells, gives the piece of cloth a lively appearance. Herringbone, simple chain stitching, and long and short stitches are used to stitch mirrors, beads, and shells. Colorful clothing, such as pink, white, yellow, and blue, is commonly worn. Blue or brown material is frequently used to provide enough contrast to enhance the attractiveness of the embroidery. Banjara needlecraft sells embroidered purses, kurtas, pillows, gift items, women's clothing fabric, bed sheets, and other home furnishings.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. Nirmal Paintings are a popular type of painting made in Nirmal. They form a small-scale industry in town. The artisans have formed a community and live in Nirmal, where they run a small-scale business. The artwork is dominated by golden tones. The name of this art form is derived from Nirmal, the location where it originated. Nirmal art has a long history dating back to the Kakatiya period. In the 14th century, a group of artisans known as the Naqash practised this skill. The Mughals were so taken with the arts that they paid for them. In the 1950s, Lady Hyderi brought these artists to the princely state of Hyderabad and encouraged their talent. The colours in these paintings are created using minerals, herbs, and other plants. The subjects of these paintings have been influenced by Ajanta and other Mughul art. This brilliant gold painting is set against a black background.

  <h5>5: Cheriyal Scroll Paintings </h5>

    <figcaption>Fig.11 - Cheriyal Scroll Painting (2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">5. Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a stylized version of Nakashi art that is now only produced in Hyderabad. The scrolls are painted in a narrative style, similar to a film roll or a comic strip, and depict stories from Indian mythology that are inextricably linked to the shorter storylines of the Puranas and Epics. Previously, similar paintings could be found throughout Andhra Pradesh and other parts of the country, each with its own distinct style and other regional characteristics dictated by local customs and traditions. Cheriyal scrolls must have been popular throughout Telangana in the past, but with the advent of television, theatres, and computers, they have been confined to their last stronghold, Cheriyal town.
