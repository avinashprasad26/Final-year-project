  <p><strong>Bihar</strong> , state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. Bihar is a state in East India, bordering Nepal. It is divided by the River Ganges, which floods its fertile plains. Important Buddhist pilgrimage sites include the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya's Mahabodhi Temple, under which the Buddha allegedly meditated. Its capital is Patna.</p>

  <br>
  <p>In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture. From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism. Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule. Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom. Area 94,163 94,163 km². Pop. (2012) 9.9 crores.</p>

  <p class="art">Madhubani Art (or Mithila painting) is a style of Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It was named after Madhubani District of Bihar, India which is where it is originated. This painting is done with various tools, such as fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.
  </p>
  <p>Madhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term "Madhubani art" being used alongside "Mithila Painting." </p>
  <p>The paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas.[3] Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status. Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively.  </p>

  <p class="P3">The Sujani embroidery work of Bihar, is a textile expressive art product, given protection under the GI registration act. It is usually a quilt or bed spread, which was earlier made of old clothes, but is now generally made of easily available fabric with embroidery done with the most simple stitches with motifs narrating stories. It is exclusively made by women in 15 villages of Bhusra in the Gaighat block of Muzaffarpur and a few villages of Madhubani in the Indian state of Bihar.
    The Sujani embroidery work of Bihar is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under the title "Sujani Embroidery Work of Bihar" and recorded under GI Application number 74, Class 26 as a textile item. The GI tag was approved on 21 September 2006.
    The earliest known traditional practice of making the embroidered Sujani quilt is traced to the 18th century. Its basic purpose was to give a soft cover to the newly born babies immediately after birth. It was then made with pieces of cloth in different colors derived from used saris and dhotis by sewing them together, adopting a simple running stitch. This process involved use of three or four patches of old saris or dhotis, fitted one over the other and then quilting them together using the thread that was also drawn from the discarded garments. Motifs expressing the desire of the mother for her newborn child were sewn on the quilt, generally done with a chain stitch in dark color.
    The Sujani technique is based on two ancient beliefs. In one ritualistic tradition, it represented the presence of a deity known as "Chitiriya Ma, the Lady of the Tatters". It symbolized the concept of unifying together incongruous elements holistically into a unified whole. The second objective was to make soft coverlet to wrap the newly born child as if the child was in the soft hug of its mother.
    The word Sujani is a compound word of ‘su’ meaning "easy and facilitating" and ‘jani’ meaning "birth".

  <p class="P3">Sikki grass crafts are various handicrafts that are made from a special kind of grass known as sikki found in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India.[1] The art of making items from sikki grass is an ancient one in the province of Bihar.[2]
    Tharu women in the southern plains of Nepal, have been weaving traditional baskets from sikki grass for centuries.[3] Nowadays, many Tharu women are engaged in producing sikki handicrafts through collaborative networks.
    Sikki is dried and the flower head is cut off. The resulting fine golden fibre is used in weaving to make toys, dolls, and baskets (dolchi). Items are sometimes painted.
    Boxes made of sikki known as pauti are given to daughters by parents on the occasion of their wedding. The boxes are used to hold sindoor, ornaments, and jewellery.
