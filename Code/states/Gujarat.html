  <p class="art">1. Gujarat has a long history of metal craft dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization. Gujarati artisans are experts at using metal to create beautiful metal pieces such as sculptures, utensils, vases, ornaments, and boxes. Each one is distinguished by its expert craftsmanship, finesse, and finishing. Iron, copper, and silver are among the metals used, as are alloys such as bell metal, white metal, and bronze. Once shaped, the surface of these metals is coloured and decorated with brilliant colours and intricate designs, giving rise to the 'meenakari' form of art.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">2. This craft is a type of surface embellishment that has been practised for over a hundred years, but is now only practised by a single family in Nirona, Kachchh. In this craft, a special castor paste is used. Castor seeds are hand-pounded to extract the oil and then boiled into a paste with coloured powder diluted in water. Yellow, red, blue, green, black, and orange pastes are kept in earthen pots with water to keep them from drying out. The kalam, an iron rod with flat ends, is used to paint half of the design with the fingers of the left hand. By pressing the two halves together, it is then impressed on the other half of the cloth. They were popular alternative textiles for clothing because they were inexpensive substitutes for embroidered textiles. This technique is now used to paint cushion covers, bed spreads, skirts, kurtas, curtains, tablecloths, and wall hangings. Geometrical motifs are generally preferred; natural motifs such as tree-of-life motifs are very popular for wall hangings.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">3. Mud work is deeply ingrained in Gujarat's history, and its popularity has spread globally over the years. Inspired by clay art, this is a long-standing tradition among Kutch artisans. Mud work frames from Kutch are wonderful representations of the state's culture and history. The art form brings to life Gujarat's authentic culture and traditions through small details such as depicting local flora and fauna. Today, artisans create eye-catching wall pieces with beautiful mirror work and hand-painted clay utensils such as pots, plates, and bowls.

  <h5>4: Soof Embroidery </h5>

    <figcaption>Fig.9 - Soof embroidery (2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. This embroidery style, which literally translates to "neat and clean," is distinguished by geometric patterns. Its v-shaped designs, known as 'leher,' as well as its wave and triangle patterns, are highly stylized. The designs on the fabric, however, cannot be pre-drawn. The intricate geometrical patterns are left to the discretion of the craftswomen, who have a talent for calculating geometrical shapes as they weave. They mentally visualise the motifs before beginning the embroidery on the reverse side of the fabric. Because the embroidery is so neat and perfectly arranged, it is frequently mistaken for machine work. These designs are popular on saris, bedsheets, linen, and tableware.

  <h5>5: Zardosi art </h5>

    <figcaption>Fig.11 - Zardosi embroidery (2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">5. The Zardosi style, which is often used to add a royal touch to fabric, is one of the finest embroidery techniques. Zardosi is a technique for creating beautiful, intricate designs on cloth using metallic coated thread. Thin strands of gold, silver, or copper are typically used to make the thread. To create these intricate designs, the thread is held with a finger on the reverse of the fabric and the aari, a sharp-pointed needle, is held on top. Sewing on the fabric in intricate patterns, craftsmen use materials such as sequins, beads, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones. This exquisite embroidery style is now commonly used in bridal trousseaus.
