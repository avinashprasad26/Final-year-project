  <p><strong>Haryana</strong> , Haryana is a North Indian state surrounding New Delhi on 3 sides. The Yamuna River runs along its eastern border with Uttar Pradesh. Shared with Punjab, the state capital Chandigarh is known for its modernist buildings and gridlike street plan designed by Swiss architect, Le Corbusier. The Zakir Hussain Rose Garden features 1,600 species, while its Rock Garden showcases sculptures made with recycled materials. </p>

  <br>
  <p>The region has been the scene of many a war because of its being ‘A Gateway to North India’. As years rolled by, successive streams of the Huns, the Turks and the Tughlaqs invaded India and decisive battles were fought on this land. At the end of the 14 century, Tamur led an army through this area to Delhi. Later, the Mughals defeated the Lodhis in the historic battle of Panipat in the year 1526. Another decisive battle was fought in the year 1556 at this very site, establishing the supremacy of the Mughals for centuries to come. Towards the middle of the 18th century, the Marathas had established their sway over Haryana.</p>

  <p class="art">Pottery is one of the most popular occupations in the rural parts of Haryana. Since the state mainly has a rural economy so this popular form of craft is considered with much importance in Haryana. The unique feature of the earthenwares of this state is that they are painted with rich and bright colors.

Pottery involves a main potter and a helper who will help him to prepare the mix. These works are generally done by the men of the village. After these earthenwares are given shape, bright and colorful patterns are painted on them. This work is generally done by a female member of the potter's family. Thus Pottery in Haryana involves a collective effort of many people.

  <h5>2: Asthal Bohar Paintings </h5>
  <figure class="rounded float-start">

    <figcaption>Fig.5 - Asthal Bohar Image(2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">The 'Asthal Bohar' paintings are also in the Rajput style, and their influence can be seen even in the Shiva temples in Panchkula and Pinjore, Venumadhava temple in Kaul, the temples in Kaithal and Pabnama, the Kapil temple in Kilayat and the Sarsainth temple in Sirsa.
Art and painting received special attention for some time during King Harsha's reign, as the King himself was a painter and a connoisseur of arts. After Harsha's death, painting flourished for a while under the Rajputs, but the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate put an end to this. The Sultans had no love for art and were busy fighting wars and battles and never patronised art.
