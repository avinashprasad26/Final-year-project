  <p class="art">Pashmina is a Kashmir wool which is mostly used for making scarves, shawls, and stoles. As India is considered to be the place where Pashmina wool was first made, this item is on the shopping list of many foreign tourists who visit India. The wool is delicate. The wool is delicate, fine, and exceptionally warm. This wool acts as an insulator. Pashmina is considered the finest craftsmanship in the world which transforms the exceptionally warm and delicate Cashmere threads to opulent accessories. The fleece of Changthangi Goat is known as Pashm which is an Urdu word & has origins in Farsi. This goat is exotic and is only found there, 15000 feet above sea level in Ladakh - Jammu and Kashmir, making the art of Pashmina even rarer and revered all over the world. Pashmina has fascinated kings, royals, and people all over the world by its magical allure and a traditional grace. Perhaps this was the reason why we chose to showcase the exquisiteness and regal demeanour of this centuries old art to the world.

  <p class="P3">Carved walnut wood-work is among the most important crafts of Kashmir. Kashmir is now one of the few places in the world where walnut is still available at an altitude of 5500-7500 feet above see level. The wood is hard and durable, its close grain and even texture facilitating fine and detailed work.
    </p><br>
    <p>Kashmir is one of the few places in the world where the walnut tree grows at a height of 5,500 feet to 7,500 feet above sea level. Walnut wood carving is one of the important crafts in the state. Walnut wood furniture occupies pride of place in Kashmiri households; it is also an essential constituent in a bride’s wedding trousseau. The wood for carving comes from either the root or the trunk of the tree. The peculiar characteristics of the walnut wood facilitate exquisitely detailed and intricate carving. Downtown Srinagar is strewn with walnut wood workshops where you find craftsmen, renowned for their carving skills, bent over the wood, chiselling and polishing. They meticulously carve out motifs of grape bunches, chinar leaves, pears, rose, etc., in the wood. A kharkhana or workshop is headed by an ustad or master and those who work alongside him are called karigars. The work in a karkhana happens mainly on three fronts—carpentry, carving and polishing. .</p>
