  <p><strong>Jharkhand</strong> , state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. Jharkhand is bordered by the states of Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the east, Odisha to the south, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Uttar Pradesh to
    the northwest. Its capital is Ranchi.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Jharkhand, one of India’s newest states, was carved out of the southern portion of Bihar in 2000. Statehood was the culmination of a long struggle carried on primarily by the Adivasis, or Scheduled Tribes (an official term applied primarily to
    indigenous communities that fall outside the predominant Indian caste hierarchy). Indian independence brought relatively little socioeconomic benefit to the people of the Jharkhand area, which led to widespread discontent with the Bihar
    administration, particularly among the tribal peoples. The tribal groups initiated a call for independence from Bihar, and in the 1980s they became militant in their demand. In the 1990s, the separation movement spread to nontribal communities,
    ultimately precipitating the creation of a new state. Area 28,833 square miles (74,677 square km). Pop. (2011) 32,966,238.</p>

  <p class="art">Sohrai and Khovar painting is a mural art traditionally practiced by women in the Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand. Traditionally used to decorate the hut walls, it is also done on paper and cloth so that it may be sold to patrons.
  </p>
  <p>Sohrai art is done at Sohrai, or harvest festivals. It is done in colour. Khovar painting is done at weddings, in black and white. </p>
  <p>The art form was popularized by Bulu Imam, who established the Sanskriti Museum & Art Gallery. In 2018, the Jharkhand government announced plans to adorn trains and government housing with Sohrai paintings. They received the Geographical
    Indication tag in 2020. The walls are first coated with a mixture of soil and dung, and then painted. </p>

  <h5>2: Dhokra Metal Casting of Jharkhand </h5>

    <figcaption>Fig.5 - Metal Craft.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">Metal-casting is done by the community of nomadic craftsmen called malhores who move from place to place collecting old brass scrap and casting images of gods and goddesses and other items such as diyas, anklets, and bells worn by
    tribals These metal smiths not only make vessels but also the tools for other artisans. The tribal communities engaged in blacksmithy in the Chhota Nagpur area are the Asur Birja tribals, who are said to be the oldest inhabitants of the area.
    Isolated from modern influences they continue to fashion folk deities and other articles that draw their inspiration from nature. They obtain the raw material from smelting ore taken from the hills or from melting scrap. The Asurs supply the
    tools needed for hunting, house construction, and cultivation. The shaping is done by hammering the sheet metal or ingot while heating or by pouring into clay or wax moulds. They use brass, an alloy of zinc and copper, and panchdhatu (five
    elements), an alloy of copper, zinc, gold, silver, and lead, along with bell-metal, an alloy of tin and copper which has a soft tint of old gold.Two distinct types of products made in brass ware and bell-metal these days are cast pots and bowls
    with the lower half black or a natural dark colour, and dhokra articles, mostly figures of riders and elephants, pradip (candle stands), and the fish type of sindhurdan (vermilion box) made by the cire-perdue or lost wax process. The flexible
    brass and silver fish made by a goldsmith community concentrated at Haveli Kharagpur in Monghyr district deserves special mention. </p>

  <h5>3: Bamboo and Cane Products </h5>

    <figcaption>Fig.7 - Bamboo Handicraft Work (2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">Bamboo products are all-natural, handcrafted, and environment friendly. Jharkhand being a natural reservoir of Bamboo creates a way of living for people. We work directly with the craftsmen of the region supporting the rural
    communities. Segments of bamboo and different kinds of sticks are widely used to produce distinctive utility and enlivening things sewn by the talented hands of the craftsmen. Stick and bamboo cane likewise be changed over into solid and exceptional
    furnishings, which are extremely well known at this point.</p>
  <p>The Cane & Bamboo products are all made of natural handcrafted cane from our production, and it takes time for skilled workers to design the products and to perfect the detailing which gives them a one-of-a-kind enduring décor look.</p>
