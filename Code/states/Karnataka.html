  <p class="art">1.	Mysore painting is a type of classical South Indian painting that developed in and around Mysore, Karnataka, under the patronage and encouragement of the Mysore monarchs. Painting has a long and famous history in Karnataka, dating back to the Ajanta period (2nd century B.C. to 7th century A.D.) During the reign of the Vijayanagar Kings, the separate school of Mysore art arose from the paintings of Vijayanagar periods (1336-1565 AD) Vijayanagar's monarchs and their feudatories promoted literature, art, architecture, religious, and philosophical debates. After the Battle of Talikota, the Vijayanagar kingdom fell apart, and the artists who had been under royal patronage fled to Mysore, Tanjore, Surpur, and other cities. The ancient Vijayanagar School of Painting gradually evolved into the different styles of painting in South India, notably the Mysore and Tanjore schools of painting, by absorbing local artistic traditions and conventions. The elegance, muted colours, and meticulous attention to detail are hallmarks of Mysore art. Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as situations from Hindu mythology, are the subjects of the majority of these paintings.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Kasuti is a type of folk embroidery that originated in the Indian state of Karnataka. Kasuti work, which is exceedingly complicated and can take up to 5,000 stitches to complete by hand, is usually done on Ilkal sarees, Ravike, and Angi. The Karnataka Handicrafts Development Corporation (KHDC) has a geographical indications (GI) protection for Kasuti needlework, granting it intellectual property rights. Kasuti's history may be traced back to the Chalukya dynasty. [2] The name Kasuti is derived from the words Kai (meaning hand) and Suti/suttu (meaning wrap/weave), implying a cotton-and-hands activity. [3] Of the 17th century, ladies courtiers in the Mysore Kingdom were supposed to be skilled in 64 arts, Kasuti being one of them. [3] The Kasuti embroidery incorporates folk designs influenced by Karnataka's rangoli patterns. Sarees embroidered with Kasuti were anticipated to be a part of the bridal trousseau in Karnataka, with the Chandrakali saree, composed of black silk with Kasuti embroidery, being the most important.

  <p class="P3">4. Channapatna toys are a type of wooden toy and doll made in the town of Channapatna in Karnataka's Ramanagara district. The World Trade Organization has designated this ancient craft as a geographical indication (GI), which is handled by the Government of Karnataka. The founder of Channapatna toys, Tippu Sultan, asked Persians to instruct local artists. [5] The Channapatna toys can be dated back to the reign of Tipu Sultan, the legendary monarch of Mysore. He was known to be a passionate supporter of the arts, particularly woodwork. As a result, Tippu gave royal patronage to woodworkers and invited woodworkers from all over Persia to come to India to research the woodwork and expose Indian artists to more innovative styles of woodwork. Over time, the art has changed dramatically. Later, a man named Bavas Miyan was tasked with introducing Japanese doll-making processes in order to boost production and lower the amount of effort required to create each toy. Ivory-wood was the most common wood used in the manufacturing of these toys for nearly two centuries, though rosewood and sandalwood were also employed on occasion.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. Kinnal Craft, also known as Kinhal Craft (Kannada: ), is a traditional wooden craft unique to the town of Kinhal, or Kinnal, in Karnataka's Koppal District. Kinhal toys and religious icons are popular in the community. Geographical Indication was recently conferred to this Craft. Kinhal was previously a thriving centre for crafts, the most well-known of which were wood carvings. The elaborate work on the wooden chariot at Hampi and the famed mural paintings in the Pampapateshwara Temple are thought to be the product of the Kinhal artists of today. This view is supported by old paper tracings discovered in one of the craftsmen' ancestral home.
