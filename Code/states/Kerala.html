Thirunadhikkara Cave Temple (now in Tamil Nadu) and Tiruvanchikulam have the oldest murals in Kerala's indigenous style. The Shiva Temple in Ettumanoor, Mattancherry Palace's Ramayana murals, and Vadakkumnatha kshetram are among Kerala mural art's best.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Brass broidered coconut shell craft of Kerala is the practise of making beautifully carved and brass broidered products such as cups, flower vases, snuff boxes, nut bowls, powder boxes, and spoons out of coconut shells by artisans in Kerala, India. Because the shell is extremely hard, this art requires great skill on the part of the artisan. Kerala's main production centres are in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Though the coconut shell craft is practised in Goa, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and West Bengal, the brass broidered variety is only found in Kerala. Many countries around the world practise coconut shell craft, including Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.

  <p class="P3">4. Kathakali, one of Kerala's most well-known forms of dance, has a significant historical and cultural significance. Kathakali is known for its distinctive make-up and attire. Kerala Kathakali Masks are nothing more than masks that mimic the faces of Kathakali dancers with the colours and make-up that are applied to the dancers' faces. The Kathakali Masks are sold as souvenirs and as display pieces. Masks made of clay, plaster of Paris, or paper mache make excellent decorative items. These oddities have green bases and are adorned with beards and black hairdos. The elaborate costumes of the Kathakali dance attract not only domestic tourists, but also international visitors. Characters of the masks differ depending on the colour of the face, beard, and headdress. These distinctions are based on the dancers' performances and the roles they play.
