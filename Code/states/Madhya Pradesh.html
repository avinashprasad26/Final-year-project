  <p><strong>Madhya Pradesh</strong> is a central state of India. Bhopal is the capital city.  It is bounded to the northeast by Uttar Pradesh, to the southeast by Chhattisgarh, to the south by Maharashtra, to the west by Gujarat, and to the northwest by Rajasthan. . </p>
<br>
<p>The modern-day state of Madhya Pradesh includes the ancient Avanti Mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during India's second wave of urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Following that, the region was ruled by India's major dynasties. As of 2019, the state of Madhya Pradesh is divided into 52 districts.</p>

  <h5>1: Pithora painting </h5>

  </figure>

  <p class="art">1. Pithora is a ritualistic wall painting done by the Rathwa, Bhils, and Bhilala tribes. Pithora is also the Hindu deity of marriage and functions, which is popular in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. As a traditional occupation, the art is passed down through generations. They were historically cave, wall, and rock paintings. Baba Pithora is the tribal deity for whom the paintings are created. Other local deities are also revered. It has religious and mythological significance to indigenous tribes and has gradually evolved into a vibrant occupation of the Bhilalas or Rathwas. In recent years, the paintings have evolved to include modern symbols such as guns and planes. Male painters are typically known as 'Lakhindra.' Menstruating females were not included in the painting because they were traditionally considered impure. Unmarried girls could help with wall background plastering with dung, water, and chuna. The chief priest involved is known as a 'Bhadvo,' a male shaman. Overall, it is a male-dominated practise. One distinguishing feature of genuine Pithora art is that no two paintings are ever alike, which serves as a unique selling point for the artists. Murals have various colour combinations, floral patterns, and symmetry. The backgrounds are white or crème, but they can also be stark red for a rustic mud colour appeal that suits modern tastes, and the paintings have become popular in urban areas. The authentic depiction of village and tribal life is done exuberantly in order to present hardship and the occasional festivity. The depicted daily chores and celebrations reflect the tribal people's coexistence of hope and despair. Even in this day and age, this is relevant. This dying art is being resurrected by artists' entrepreneurship, market innovations, and government support, allowing for the creation of these magnificent expressions of art and culture and contributing to history and heritage as these paintings are a repository of rich tribal heritage.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">2. Mandana paintings are Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh wall and floor paintings. Mandana are drawn to protect the home and hearth, to welcome gods into the home, and to mark festive occasions. Meena women in Rajasthan's Hadoti region are skilled at creating designs with perfect symmetry and accuracy. The art is performed on the floor and the wall. The art is much more pronounced and associated with the Meena community of Hadoti. Cow dung is mixed with rati, a local clay, and red ochre to prepare the ground. The motif is created with lime or chalk powder. A piece of cotton, a tuft of hair, or a crude brush made out of a date stick are used as tools. The design could include Ganesha, peacocks, working women, tigers, floral motifs, and so on.

  <p class="P3">3. Bagh print is a traditional Indian handicraft that originated in Bagh, Madhya Pradesh, India. Hand printed wood block relief prints with naturally sourced pigments and dyes distinguish the process. Bagh print motifs are typically geometric, paisley, or floral compositions, dyed with vegetable colours of red and black on a white background, and are a popular textile printing product. It gets its name from the village of Bagh, which is located on the banks of the Bagh River. The Bagh print's origins are unknown, but it is thought to be over 1,000 years old, with techniques passed down through family practise from generation to generation. It is possible that the craft was transported by settlers from Jawad in Madhya Pradesh, India, or by printers from Rajasthan. Another possibility is that the Chhipas, or traditional cloth printers, of the Muslim Khatri community who now practise Bagh print travelled to the area around 400 years ago from Larkana in Sindh province, Pakistan, which is known for the Arjak block printing tradition. In 2011, a Bagh print design was used in a Madhya Pradesh state tableau theme at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26, 2011. A Shalbhanjika, the celestial apsara of the 11th century, was featured in the parade, dressed in Bagh printed clothing.

  <p class="P3">4. Longpi pottery, also known as stone pottery or black pottery, is a traditional Manipur craft. The original name, Longpi pottery, is derived from the village of Longpi in Manipur. This is where the Tangkhul Naga tribe creates their beautiful earthenware. The people of Manipur's Ukhrul district attribute the origins of this craft to Goddess Panthoibi, the mother of artifact-making. She represents a stage in our evolution. Longpi Pottery is therefore required for performing rituals on festive occasions such as childbirth and marriage. Manipuri pottery is distinct in both style and technique. The material used is a three-to-one mixture of clay and powdered stone – Black Serpentite stone and weathered rock. Serpentite rock provides strength, and weathered rock acts as a binding agent. The resulting paste is then hand-rolled into desired shapes. The potter's wheel is not used by the Longpi. All shaping is done by hand and with the assistance of moulds. The potter then moves the clay around, shaping and forming the pot. A rounded stone is used to support the pot from the inside, and it is beaten to the desired shape and thickness.

  <p class="P3">5. Papier Mache is an art form in which paper pulp is mixed with adhesive to create an artefact or decorative item. It is a popular craft practised all over the world, including Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. The eco-friendly art of papier mache, regenerated from waste and transformed into attractive collectibles, truly reflects green design. Local artists working in Ujjain find ways to create objects with the precision of machines while using the least amount of energy and resources. This demonstrates how effortlessly and magically craftsmen can transform impressions of wild creatures into beautiful works of art. The main ingredients in the mixture that makes the best of waste are scarp paper, glue, and chalk powder. Papers are soaked in water for a few days before being mashed into a pulp that is then dried. The dry pulp is either used immediately or stored for later use. When the dough is needed, the dry paper mash is soaked in water again and mixed with glue and chalk powder. Craftsmen make Plaster of Paris moulds to provide the desired structure. The papier-mache dough is flattened into thick sheets and placed in the moulds for this purpose. The moulded pieces are smoothed with sandpaper after drying in the natural heat of the sun, then painted with vibrant colours. The creation includes animal masks and god statues, but the main artefact that breathes life into this craft is the bird. No one can tell the difference between these and real birds because they are made in their true sizes and painted in their true colours. The anatomical details, pose, feather details, colour gradation, and expressions are all captured with great detail. These collectibles can be purchased from local shops in Ujjain or by contacting the artists. Because Papier Mache items are lightweight and portable, they can be easily purchased and given as gifts to family and friends.
