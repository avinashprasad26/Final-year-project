  </figure>

  <p class="art">1. The Warli Painting tradition in Maharashtra is considered one of the best examples of folk art. The Warli tribe, located outside of Mumbai, is one of the largest in India. Despite their proximity to one of India's largest cities, the Warli shun much of modern culture. The marriage of God Palghat is depicted in Maharashtra's Warli art. Even though the tribal form of art is estimated to date back to the 10th century A.D., the style of Warli painting was not recognised until the 1970s. The Warli culture is based on the concept of Mother Nature, and natural aspects are frequently shown in Warli art. Farming is their main source of income and a significant supply of food.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">2.  Kolhapuri chappals are handcrafted and braided leather slippers from India that are tanned locally using vegetable dyes. Kolhapuri Chappals, also known as Kolhapuris, are a type of open-toed, T-strap sandal made of braided leather. Mules and braided leather shoe styles are also popular. Kolhapuri Chappals date back to the 12th century, when King Bijjala and his prime minister Basavanna encouraged the production of Kolhapuri Chappals to support local cobblers. Kolhapuris were first worn in the 13th century, according to historical records. Previously known as Kapashi, Paytaan, Kachkadi, Bakkalnali, and Pukri, the name denoted the village where they were manufactured.

  <p class="P3">3. Kolhapur is well-known for its Kolhapuri saaj, a unique type of necklace worn here. It is popular among women all over the country due to its intricate designs, one-of-a-kind appeal, and royal grandeur. Previously, the saaj was made up of 21 leaves with various design pendants. It is thought to have been created around 60 years ago. Making this necklace takes a lot of patience and skill. The Peshwas and Marathas left behind the majority of the ornaments made in Kolhapur. Chokar, bormal, mohanmal, har and malas, chaplahar, putlihar, and pohehar are some other popular pieces of jewellery in the city, as is thushi, a choker made of intricately bound gold beads. Tourists can also buy patlya, which are broad bangles; tode, which are finely carved thick bangles; bangdya, which are two sets of bangles; chinchpeti, which is a choker; nath, which is a nose ring; and tanmani, which is a short necklace. The bajuband, or armlet, is also popular, as are flower-shaped earrings.

    <figcaption>Fig.9 - Himroo (2).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. Mashru (also spelled mashroo) is a woven fabric made of silk and cotton. It was historically a type of hand-woven satin silk fabric found in the Indian subcontinent, and its proper application is described in the 16th-century Ain-i-Akbari. Misry (or misru) is a Sanskrit word that means 'permitted.' It is derived from the Arabic word mashry. During the Mughal period, Mashru was used for the costumes of courtiers and nobles. Mashru is thought to be an Indian invention.
Himroo is a silk and cotton fabric produced locally in Aurangabad. Himroo was brought to Aurangabad during Mohammad Tughlaq's reign, when he relocated his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, Aurangabad. Hisroo is derived from the Persian word Hum-ruh, which means'similar.' Himroo is a replica of Kinkhwab, which was once woven with pure gold and silver threads and was intended for royal families. Himroo is characterised by his use of Persian designs and his distinct appearance. Himroo from Aurangabad is well-known for its distinct style and design. Some historians believe Himroo was created by local craftsmen with little Persian influence. Himroo is woven in the Aurangabad neighbourhood near Delhi Gate and Zaffar Gate.
