  <p class="P3">3. The double-weave mat known as the kaunaphak reed mat is a unique Manipur craft. The reed used to weave the mat is known as kauna in Meithei, a Manipuri tribal language. Locals make the mat for their own use as well as for commercial purposes. Phak is a yellow-colored succulent stem of a plant that grows in water. Reeds for the mats are carefully selected. Only when the plant has reached maturity is it cut. After being cut, the stems dry and become soft, pithy, and brittle. A bunch of cut stems of the appropriate length are then woven with bamboo placed at appropriate distances to create the desired length of the mat. The border is about an inch wide and has an interesting pattern. The kauna reed mats should not be washed because the reed deteriorates when exposed to moisture.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. Longpi pottery, also known as stone pottery or black pottery, is a traditional Manipur craft. The original name, Longpi pottery, is derived from the village of Longpi in Manipur. This is where the Tangkhul Naga tribe creates their beautiful earthenware. The people of Manipur's Ukhrul district attribute the origins of this craft to Goddess Panthoibi, the mother of artifact-making. She represents a stage in our evolution. Longpi Pottery is therefore required for performing rituals on festive occasions such as childbirth and marriage. Manipuri pottery is distinct in both style and technique. The material used is a three-to-one mixture of clay and powdered stone â€“ Black Serpentite stone and weathered rock. Serpentite rock provides strength, and weathered rock acts as a binding agent. The resulting paste is then hand-rolled into desired shapes. The potter's wheel is not used by the Longpi. All shaping is done by hand and with the assistance of moulds. The potter then moves the clay around, shaping and forming the pot. A rounded stone is used to support the pot from the inside, and it is beaten to the desired shape and thickness.

  <p class="P3">5. The art of printing different patterns on fabrics using patterned blocks is known as block printing. This art form employs natural colours and is used to create bedsheets, sarees, and other textiles. This handicraft demonstrates the incredible talent of Manipur's artisans, who can make any fabric look extraordinary. This art form draws both locals and tourists. Traditionally, village chiefs were given a 'Khamen Chatpa,' which is a handprinted block towel. Manipur's traditional ceremonies feature block-printed dresses.
