  <p class="art">1.	Pattachitra is an traditional painting of Odisha. These paintings are inspired by Jagannath and the Vaishnava sect and are based on Hindu mythology. All of the colours used in the paintings are natural, and the paintings are made entirely by hand by Chitrakaras, an Odiya painter. The Pattachitra style of painting is one of Odisha's oldest and most popular art forms. Pattachitra is derived from the Sanskrit words patta, which means canvas, and chitra, which means picture. Pattachitra is thus a canvas painting characterised by rich colourful application, creative motifs and designs, and depiction of simple themes, mostly mythological in nature. Pattachitra painting traditions date back over a thousand years.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Pipili village in the Puri district of Odisha well known for its appliqué work, also known as Chandua. "Appliqué" is derived from the French word appliquer, which means "to put on." This technique is divided into two variations: appliqué, in which a fabric shape is sewn over a base layer, and reverse appliqué, in which two layers of fabric are laid down, and a shape is cut out from the upper layer, exposing the lower layer, before both are stitched together. It is one of the products that has been granted Geographical Indication (GI) status by the Indian government. Nowadays, it is more commonly found in household, decorative, and festival products. The appliqué items are primarily used during deity rituals and jatras, particularly the colourful appliqué cloth covers of the deities' three rathas during Rath Jatra. Apart from colour differences, the basic design of all three is similar. Appliqué work is also used to make pillows, seats, and deity ritual dresses. Waterproof material for umbrellas, velvet for tents, cotton, and threads are all part of the base cloth. The work incorporates mythical and natural figures such as peacocks, ducks, parrots, trees, elephants, creepers, flowers such as jasmine and lotus, the Sun, half-moon, and Rahu (a mythical demon who once who swallowed up the sun). Embroidery and stitching are used in the craft. The makers use straight stitch, satin stitch, blind stitch, or buttonhole stitch to attach the pieces of cloth. They also do mirror work and a lot of decorative stitches.

  <p class="P3">3. Etching and painting on palm leaves, one of the world's oldest crafts, is still practised in the Indian state of Odisha. The art, known as Talapatrachitras there, has reached new heights. Palm leaf etchings are prized decorations in every Indian home. When written communication began, so did the art. Messages and manuscripts were written on palm leaves and distributed. Gradually, the trend of embellishing text with images emerged, and it evolved into an art form in its own right. Ethnic art was still one of the most respected there, and it is primarily practised by artists in Puri and Cuttak. The ethnic art form consists primarily of inscribing letters and artistic designs on palm-leaf, which is usually cut into standard sizes and held together by two wooden plank covers stringed through a hole in the centre. To prepare the palm leaf, first cut and semi-dry the unripe leaves of the palm tree. They are then buried in swamps for 4-5 days to season before being dried in the shade. These are then stitched or strung together as necessary. They are sometimes stitched after the etching is finished. On leaf strips, etching is done within lines with an iron pen. The etching is highlighted by rubbing a paste made of bean leaves, charcoal made of burnt coconut shells, til oil, and turmeric on it. Colors are used sparingly in this area, only as fillers and in very subdued tones. Painting is done with vegetable and mineral colours. The artists of palm leaf etchings capture mythological incidents, Gods and Goddesses figures complete with hair style and dress details, animals, flowers and trees, and so on. The most common themes are Radha and Krishna, Durga, Ganesha, and Saraswati. There are also stories and incidents from the Mahabharat, Ramayana, and other epics etched. Nature scenes are also depicted in the paintings and drawings.

  <p class="P3">4. Stone carving is an ancient practise in Odisha of sculpting stone into art and utilitarian objects. It is a centuries-old tradition in the Indian state of Odisha. Stone carving is primarily practised by artisans in Puri, Bhubaneswar, and Lalitgiri in the Cuttack district, with some carvings also found in Khiching in the Mayurbhanj district. Stone carving is a major handcraft in Odisha. The Sun Temple of Konark, with its intricate sculpture and delicate carvings on the red vivid sandstone, is an example of the practise. Other notable monuments include the Udayagiri and Ratnagiri stupas, as well as temples at Jagannath, Lingaraj, Mukteshwar, and other temples in the region. Konark stone carving employed sandstone, soapstone, serpentinite, Makrana marble, and granite. Skilled artists can use khadipathara, a soft white soapstone, or kochilapathara, a slightly harder greenish chlorite. Commonly used rocks include pinkish khandolite, sahanapathara or baulapathara, and the hardest of all, black granite and muguni pathara. On the cut-to-size stone, an outline is first drawn. After the outline has been engraved, the final figure is created by removing the unwanted portions. This is accomplished by chiselling out the excess material from the harder stones. It is done with softer stones by scraping out the excess material with a sharp flat-edged iron tool. Various sizes of hammers and chisels are used (e.g., the muna, patili, martual, thuk-thuki and nitana).

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">5. Kantha, also spelled kanta and qanta, is a type of embroidery craft popular in India's eastern states of West Bengal, Tripura, and Odisha, as well as Bangladesh. In Odisha, old saris are stacked and hand-stitched together to make a thin cushion. This is typically used above or instead of a bed cushion. Women in India's Bengal region traditionally wear "Kantha saris." Nowadays, embroidery, also known as "kantha stitching," is stitched on saris, kurtas (or panjabi), and churidars, among other garments, and is gaining popularity due to its aesthetic value and handmade characteristics. Kantha is a type of embroidery that is commonly practised by rural women. Kantha embroidery was traditionally done on soft dhotis and saris with a simple running stitch along the edges. They were known as Lepkantha or Sujni Kantha depending on the use of the finished product. The embroidered cloth can be used to make shawls, mirror covers, boxes, and pillows, among other things. In some cases, the entire cloth is covered with running stitches, with beautiful motifs of flowers, animals, birds, geometrical shapes, and themes from everyday life. The stitching on the fabric gives it a wrinkled, wavy appearance. Kantha is now used to make a broader range of garments, including sarees, dupattas, shirts for men and women, bedding, and other furnishing fabrics, mostly out of cotton and silk. The modern Kantha-stitch craft industry is comprised of a highly complex multi-staged production model.
