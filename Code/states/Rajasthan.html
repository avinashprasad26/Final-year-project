  <p><strong>Rajasthan</strong> is a state in northern India. Jaipur is the capital city.  It is the largest Indian state in terms of land area and the seventh largest in terms of population. It is bounded to the north by Punjab, to the northeast by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, to the southeast by Madhya Pradesh, and to the southwest by Gujarat. The ruins of the Indus Valley Civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range and eastern Rajasthan, and the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site known for its bird life are among its major features. </p>
<br>
<p>Rajasthan has three national tiger reserves: Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar, and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota. As of 2019, the state of Rajasthan is divided into 33 districts.</p>

  <h5>1: Bone Carving </h5>

  </figure>

  <p class="art">1.	Following the ivory ban, artists began crafting objects out of horn and bone. Handles for weapons such as swords and daggers, howdahs for riding elephants, palanquins, thrones, sofas, and divans are among the items manufactured. Salvers, tumblers, jewellery, hukka bases, and toys carved in the shapes of animals, birds, and fish are among the various items manufactured. There are figures showing gods and animals, mythological motifs, and folk motifs that demonstrate the complexity of carving. Bangle boxes, chessmen, animal figures, combs, and paper cutters are among the numerous things manufactured, some of which are painted. The jali is delicately cut and perforated in the boxes, with floral patterns and human and animal motifs. There is a unique item known as bartana, shaped like a paper knife, which is passed between the forehead and the turban to ease tension. Jaipur, Ajmer, Bikaner, and Jodhpur are the primary centres for this craft. Jodhpur is known for its bangles, which come in a variety of sizes and encompass the entire arm from wrist to shoulder. Glass beads, coloured lace, gold leaf, or simple colour embellishments are frequently used to embellish these bracelets. Seashell fragments are glued together around the bone to create a mosaic-like exterior covering. This is mostly a decorative piece. Jodhpur is the centre of this craft.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Camel Bone Work is a type of art that is created by chopping animal bones and incorporating antlers and spikes. It can be found on a bone or in the work of a figure. It is used by a variety of social arts, usually as a less expensive, and more recently, a constitutional substitute for ivory casting. With iconic figures like the Swimming Reindeer (antler) and numerous other Venus statuettes, it was notable in ancient art. Craftsmen and artisans, particularly metalworkers, utilised bone to inspect their work. These are referred to as "trial-pieces". Camel Bone Work is a complicated Indian art technique that requires constant attention and a long shower after completion. Camel Bone Work artists require a lot of concentration. The beauty of art is its complexity. Grinders and shapers are among the machines employed, and they are both delicate and fragile. The job necessitates tenacity, strength, and good lungs. Camel Bone Work dust can trigger asthma attacks, making it difficult to work. The artisans work for nearly 18-20 hours a day, adding these scenarios to the artifacts.

  <p class="P3">3. Razais/Quilts from Jaipur- The world-famous Jaipur Razais, or Quilts, have a long history. The origins of the Jaipuri Razai can be traced back to around 280 years ago, when a group of Mansuris (cotton mattress and quilt makers) relocated from Amber to Jaipur. Maharaja Madho Singh ji received a jewel of razai (quilt) from Kadar Bux, a young razai maker, weighing barely a pao (250gms.) of cotton. The Maharaja was so impressed that he bestowed the title of Patel on Kadar Bux and handed him two stores close to Hawa Hahal, opposite the Sawai Man Singh Hall. Today, there are several small shops run by descendants of Kadar Bus that carry on the Rajai-making legacy. The carding (dhunai) of the cotton is the secret of Jaipuri quilts. It's done by hand to keep the quilts particularly light and toasty. Quilts are divided into three categories: cotton, velvet, and silk, with velvet being the most expensive. The type of cloth and cotton used, as well as the method of carding and stitching, determine the price of a quilt.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4.  Phad painting, also known as phad, is a religious scroll painting and folk art style popular in Rajasthan, India. This form of painting is generally done on a phad, which is a long piece of cloth or canvas. The phadss depicts the stories of Rajasthan's folk deities, primarily Pabuji and Devnarayan. The Bhopas, or priest-singers, traditionally take painted phads with them and utilise them as mobile shrines for the Rebari community's folk deities. Pabuji's phads are typically 15 feet (4.6 metres) long, whereas Devnarayan's phads are typically 30 feet long. The phads are traditionally painted with vegetable colours.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">5. Blue Pottery is widely recognized as a traditional craft of Jaipur, though it is Turko-Persian in origin. The eye-catching blue dye used to tint the pottery gave it the name "blue pottery." The glazed and low-fired Jaipur blue pottery is made of a frit substance akin to Egyptian faience. No clay is used; instead, quartz stone powder, powdered glass, Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), borax, gum, and water are combined to make the pottery'dough. Katira Gond powder (a gum) and saaji (sodium bicarbonate) are among the components listed by another source. Some of the pottery is semi-transparent, featuring animal and bird designs. They're brittle because they're burnt at such a low temperature. The items are mostly decorative, such as ashtrays, vases, coasters, small bowls, and trinket boxes. The colour palette is limited to blue derived from cobalt oxide, green derived from copper oxide, and white, though other non-traditional colours such as yellow and brown are occasionally included.
