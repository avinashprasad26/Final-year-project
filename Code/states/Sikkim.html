  <p><strong>Sikkim</strong> is a state in north-eastern India. Gangtok is the capital city. Sikkim produces the most cardamom in India and is the world's second largest producer of the spice after Guatemala. Sikkim achieved its goal of converting its agriculture to 100% organic between 2003 and 2016, becoming the first state in India to do so. </p>
<br>
<p>Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, which includes alpine and subtropical climates, as well as hosting Kangchenjunga, India's highest peak and the third highest on the planet. As of 2019, the state of Sikkim is divided into 6 districts.</p>

  <h5>1: Thangka painting </h5>

  <p class="art">1. A thangka, also spelled tangka, thanka, or tanka, is a Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton or silk appliqu√© that typically depicts a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. When not on display, thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up, mounted on a textile backing in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. Thangkas can last a long time if properly cared for, but due to their delicate nature, they must be stored in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are small, roughly the size of a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. The majority of thangkas were created for personal meditation or to instruct monastic students. They frequently have intricate compositions with many very small figures. In a symmetrical composition, a central deity is frequently surrounded by other identified figures. Narrative scenes are uncommon, but they do occur. Thangkas are important teaching tools that depict the Buddha's life, the lives of various influential lamas, and other deities and bodhisattvas. The Wheel of Life (Bhavachakra) is a visual representation of the Abhidharma teachings (Art of Enlightenment). The term is sometimes applied to works in media other than painting, such as metal reliefs and woodblock prints. Today, printed reproductions of painted thangkas at poster size are widely used for both devotional and decorative purposes. Many tangkas were made in sets, but they frequently became separated over time.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Sikkim's ancient art form is wood carving. Wood carving is done on a variety of products such as 'Choktsis' (carved table), bakchok (square table), wooden masks, decorative screens, lucky signs, alters, lamp stands, and other decorative items in traditional designs such as dragons, birds, and phoenix. Wood is the primary raw material used in this craft. Typically, three types of wood are used: 'tooni' (toona celiata), 'rani chaap' (Macalia Exelsa), and 'okher' (Walnut).
To begin, a piece of wood is cut into the desired shape. After seasoning and papering it smooth, the designs are carved out with very fine chisels and tools. The carved wood pieces are then assembled and ready for a coat or two of colourful paint or polish.

  <p class="P3">3. Sikkim, home to three distinct races, the Lepchas, Bhutias, and Tsongs, is a major player in handloom weaving. The Lepcha weave is synonymous with handloom weaving in Sikkim. In ancient times, the Lepchas of Sikkim were said to weave clothes with yarn spun from the stinging nettle (sisnu) plant. Cotton and woollen yarn are now used in conjunction with vegetable dyes and synthetic colours. Lepcha women weave on traditional back-strap loin-looms, which improves the fabric's quality. The Lepcha women use an indigenous vertical frame loom with a back strap. The weave frame is made of bamboo or a variety of woods that are available. The loin loom can weave almost any type of weave. The weaving pattern possibilities on a loin loom are limitless. The women's woven cloth is used to make traditional coats for women. Cotton yarn is the primary material, while woollen yarn is used for the motifs on the coat. Cotton is the primary raw material used by the Lepchas for clothing, and sheep wool is used for blankets. Lepchas raise their own sheep for wool, and some wool is purchased from local traders. The yarn is dyed and dried for at least a week before being woven on a loom. In dyeing, both vegetable dyes and synthetic colours are used. The predominant colours are white, black, red, yellow, and green, among others. Handloom products range from simple to intricate patterns.

  <p class="P3">4. Choktse, a foldable table from Gangtok, is one of Sikkim's most well-known products, with national and international acclaim. Choktse tables are prepared in a variety of designs with distinctive motifs. Choktses are small wooden tables that have been carefully painted and polished. The tables are foldable and portable, and come in a variety of sizes. They are Tibetan in origin and are made from kath wood. The different parts of these tables are first cut out of wood and then carved with the desired motifs. A paper stencil is used to transfer the etching pattern onto the wood. A drilling machine is used to drill holes in the areas that will be completely removed around the motif. Using a set of tools, details of the form are carved out. If the carved panel is to be sold as an individual piece, it is attached to a choktse and painted and polished. The choktse is rigorously treated for smoothness and other quality measures before being primed and dried.
