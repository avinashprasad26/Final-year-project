  <p class="art">1. Thanjavur painting is a traditional South Indian painting style that originated in the Tamil Nadu town of Thanjavur (also known as Tanjore). The art form's immediate resources and inspiration date back to around 1600 AD, when the Nayakas of Thanjavur, under the Vijayanagara Rayas suzerainty, encouraged art—most notably, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil, and temple painting of primarily Hindu religious subjects. The famous gold finish distinguishes it. Thanjavur art, as we know it today, is thought to have begun in the Maratha palace of Thanjavur (1676–1855). [1] In 2007–08, the Government of India designated it as a geographical indication. Rich and bright colours, simple classic compositions, sparkling gold foils superimposed on delicate but vast gesso work, and inlay of glass beads and pieces, or very rarely genuine and semi-precious jewels are all hallmarks of Thanjavur paintings. Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha, and even European or Company painting styles can be seen in Thanjavur paintings. The subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints, and they serve as devotional icons.  Palagai padam (palagai = "wooden plank"; padam = "picture") is the local term for Thanjavur paintings, which are panel paintings done on wooden planks. In recent times, these paintings have become mementos for festive occasions in South India – colourful works of art to decorate rooms, collectors' goods for art aficionados, and, tragically, dime-a-dozen bric-a-brac to be purchased from street corner practitioners.</p>

  <p class="P3">2. Bronze idols and statues made in Swamimalai, Tamil Nadu are known as Swamimalai Bronze Icons. In 2008–09, the Government of India designated it as a geographical indicator. Raja Raja I commissioned a group of sculptors to build the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur during the Chola Empire's rule. The sculptors assisted in the casting of statues for Airavatesvara Temple before settling in Swamimalai. The statues range in height from 6 feet (1.8 m) to 12 feet (3.7 m). To maintain quality, the production is strictly monitored and limited in number. The majority of the statues created are of Hindu deities. Other animal iconography, as well as male and female characters, are cast according to specifications. The statues are constructed using the wax casting technique, and the cast might be solid or hollow. Swamimalai's bronze icons are in high demand and are exported to a variety of countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Malaysia, and Thailand. Approximately 60% of total production is exported, and the statues are installed in Hindu temples built by NRIs in various countries.

  <p class="P3">3. All over Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, clay figures are made. Traditionally, each village has an enormous terracotta horse guarding its entrance, which is the horse of Ayyanaar, a religious figure, the gramdevta of the village, and its protector against all evils. Aiyyanar has a massive moustache, big teeth, and wide open eyes that are always on guard. Ayyanaar is surrounded by his horses and commanders, or veerans, at the entrance. The oldest Ayyanaars and horses can be found in Salem. The largest terracotta horses are made in the Salem and Pudukottai districts";" smaller figures, human, divine, and animal, are made throughout the state. Because the firing process takes so long, moulds are becoming popular as a way to speed up the process. Ayyanaar figures can be found in Chettampatti and Nallur (Tiruchirapalli district), Tirripuyanam (Madurai district), and Vadugapalayam village sanctuaries (Coimbatore district). Clay Ganeshas are made and sold everywhere on Vinayaka Chathurthi. These can be glazed, painted, baked, or left unbaked and range in height from a few centimetres to a metre. After the festival, the models are immersed in wells, and the unbaked form is preferred because it crumbles easily. Water drawing and storing pots and cooking vessels are among the other items made. During the Pongal harvest festival, old pots in the house are replaced with new cooking pots, grain storage vessels, and a new container for the auspicious tulasi/holy basil plant. The pots represent life's continuity, creation, destruction, and rebirth.

  <p class="P3">4. Thanjavur, also known as Tanjore, is a district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Thanjavur is well-known for its tradition, arts, architecture, and culture, as well as the district's heritage temples. Veena is an Indian traditional and classical musical instrument. Veena represents traditional Indian art and culture. Music and dance are important parts of Tamil Nadu's cultural life, and Veena playing is one of them. As a result, Veena making has become a major craft in Thanjavur. Many Thanjavur families are involved in the production of Veenas. Saraswathi, the goddess of learning and the arts, is associated with the Veena. This instrument is popular in southern India and plays an important role in Carnatic sangeet. Traditional art is passed down from generation to generation. According to Hindu mythology, gods and goddesses play various instruments, including the veena, which is played by the goddess Saraswathi. The instruments are made of wood from the Jackfruit tree. On a single block of wood, the skilled art of Veena making is performed. Veena is created in a number of stages. The instruments are manufactured and sold worldwide in response to customer demand. In Thanjavur's famous temples and on other auspicious occasions, Veena is played alongside other musical instruments.

  <p class="P3">5. Kanchipuram silk saris are silk saris produced in the Kanchipuram region of Tamil Nadu, India. Most women in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh wear these saris as bridal and special occasion saris. The Government of India designated it as a geographical indication in 2005–2006. Pure mulberry silk thread is used to weave the saris. The pure mulberry silk and Zari used to make Kanchipuram saris are both from South India. Three shuttles are used to weave a Kanchipuram sari. While the weaver is working on the right side shuttle, his assistant is working on the left side shuttle. The colour and design of the border are usually quite different from the body. If the mundhi (the sari's hanging end) needs to be woven in a different shade, it is first woven separately and then delicately joined to the Sari. A zigzag line is often used to indicate the point where the body meets the mundhi. The body and border of a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari are woven separately and then interlocked together. The border is so tightly woven that even if the sari tears, it will not detach. This distinguishes kanchipuram silk saris from others.
