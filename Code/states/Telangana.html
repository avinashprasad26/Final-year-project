          <p>Bidriware is a renowned metal handicraft that derives its name from Bidar, presently in Karnataka. It was believed to have originated in 14th century AD during the reign of Bahamani Sultans.</p>
          <p>The term 'Bidriware' therefore represents the manufacture of a unique metalware that is named after the region of Bidar. The Bahamani sultans had ruled Bidar in the 14th–15th centuries. Bidriware was first practised in ancient Persia and then it was brought to India by Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti’s followers. The art form developed due to a mix of Persian and Arabic cultures and after the fusion with local style, a new and unique style of its own was created. The Nizam of Hyderabad introduced the art form in Aurangabad, which was part of Nizam’s Hyderabad state before 1947.</p>
          <p>Bidriware is an eight-stage process. Those are moulding, smoothening by file and the process of designing by chisels. It is then followed by engraving using chisel and hammer where pure silver inlaying is done. It is subjected to smoothening again, followed by buffing and finally oxidising by making use of soil and ammonium chloride. Bidriware is therefore manufactured from an alloy of copper and zinc metals, in the ratio 1:16 by means of casting. Initially the presence of zinc ushers alloy a deep black color. Firstly, a mould is created using soil and this is made malleable by adding castor oil and resin. The molten metal is later poured to create a cast piece followed by smoothened through filing. The casting is further coated with a strong copper sulphate solution to gain a temporary black coating. Then the designs are etched freehand over this using a metal stylus.This is eventually secured in a vise and the Bidri craftsmen make use of small chisels to engrave the designs over this freehand etching. Fine wire or even flattened strips of pure silver are clearly hammered into the grooves.The item is then filed and buffed, as well as smoothed to remove the temporary black coating. This results in a silver inlay that is not that clearly distinguishable compared to the gleaming metallic surface, which is now completely silvery white.</p>

It is one among the five precious jewels that have been used for the purpose of adornment for more than 5000 years. The lustre and lucidity of pearls makes this a symbol of purity and it is therefore considered as one of the most sought after jewels. Hyderabad, the heart of Deccan Plateau and the capital city of Telangana has earned the sobriquet of ‘Pearl City’ from a long time as the city is associated with the lucrative trade of splendid pearls and various forms of jewellery made using Pearls. Pearl trading was greatly encouraged by the Nizam’s and the Qutb Shahi rulers who are believed to have a lot of affinity for the sparkling jewel. The kings and queens adorned pearls on their robes and even crushed the pearls and applied it topically to enhancing their physical beauty. The wealthy life style led by the royals also resulted in the influx of craftsman from all over the world who were widely engaged in making quality pearl jewellery. Many families had migrated from Basra in Persia to Hyderabad centuries ago.
