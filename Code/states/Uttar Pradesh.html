              <p class="P3">Sanjhi art is a type of stencilling that originated in Mathura, Krishna's hometown. It is regarded as one of the finest forms of spiritual expression because of its inherent spiritual meanings that extend beyond immediate visual appeal. Sanjhi themes were used to embellish the walls and floors of temples in the 16th and 17th centuries. Sanjhi is derived from the Hindi word sandhya, which refers to the period of dusk when the art form is most commonly associated. The art depicts several Indian mythological stories, with a particular focus on Krishna's Leela. According to legend, Radhe created Sanjhi rangolis out of natural hues, flowers, leaves, and coloured stones to woo Krishna. Soon after, the other gopis followed suit, creating complex decorations to dazzle Krishna. Sanjhi designs are created by cutting stencils out of paper (usually handmade) with specially crafted scissors. These stencils are used to design rangoli patterns on flat surfaces or in water. After that, dry colours are dusted onto the surface. As important as cutting the design is filling the colours and lifting the stencils. Common motifs include peacocks, bullock carts, horses, cows, butterflies, and trees. The artist's passion and profound love for the Blue God is reflected in the meticulous craftsmanship. An complex Sanjhi artwork could take anything from an hour to a month to complete.
