  <p><strong>Uttarkhand</strong> is a state in northern India. Dehradun is the capital city. Due to its religious significance and numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state, it is often referred to as the "Devbhumi"(Land of the Gods). Uttarakhand is well-known for its natural environment, which includes the Himalayas, Bhabar, and Terai regions. It is bounded to the north by China's Tibet Autonomous Region, to the east by Nepal's Sudurpashchim Province, and to the west and north-west by the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. </p>
<br>
<p>The state's residents are known as Uttarakhandis or depending on their region of origin, Garhwalis or Kumaonis. As of 2022, the state of Uttarkhand is divided into 13 districts.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="art">1. The Aipan art form originated in Almora, Uttarakhand, during the reign of the Chand dynasty. It flourished in the Kumaon region during the reign of the Chand dynasty. The designs and motifs are inspired by the community's beliefs as well as various aspects of nature. Aipan is an established-ritualistic folk art that originated in Kumaon in the Indian Himalayas. The art is primarily performed for special occasions, household ceremonies, and rituals. Practitioners believe it summons a divine power that brings good fortune and deters evil. The art is unique because it is created on empty brick-red walls known as Geru. The actual art is created with a white paste made of rice flour. The art is frequently found on the floors and walls of Puja rooms and home entrances. It is mostly practised by Kumaoni women. The art form has significant social, cultural, and religious significance.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">2. Pahari painting is an umbrella term for a type of Indian painting that originated in the Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India during the 17th and 19th centuries, most notably Basohli, Mankot, Nurpur, Chamba, Kangra, Guler, Mandi, and Garhwal. Nainsukh was a well-known master of the mid-18th century, and his family workshop continued for another two generations. The depiction of the eternal love of Hindu deities Radha and Krishna is the central theme of Pahari painting. During the 17th and 19th centuries, the Pahari school developed and flourished in Himachal Pradesh, stretching from Jammu to Garhwal in sub-Himalayan India. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense Basohli Painting, which originated in Jammu and Kashmir, to delicate and lyrical Kangra paintings, which became synonymous with the style before other schools of painting developed, and finally to Mola Ram's poetic and cinematic representations in Garhwali Paintings. Paintings of Radha and Krishna inspired by Jayadeva's Gita Govinda culminated the Kangra style.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">3. Uttarakhand's Pahadi Juniyali doll is the latest addition to the state's vast collection of arts and crafts. A company called Phyonli & Pines LLP has released a line of Pahadi Doll Junyali, similar to its American cousin Barbie, in a variety of shapes and sizes, including a Juniyali with a Pichora. The Juniyali doll joins the Gudda Guddi dolls of Uttarakhand, which are already well-known online. No matter how modern the times become, the people of Uttarakhand's strong attachment to their divine roots remains unbroken. The Kings have always patronised temple architecture. Without realising it, Uttarakhand's art and craft heritage draws heavily from the architecture of its temples and their divine symbols, embedded sacred geometry, and so on.

  </figure>

  <p class="P3">4. Ringal is a socioeconomically and ecologically significant type of bamboo that can be found in abundance in the rich forests of the Garhwal Himalayas. Local communities regard ringal, or ningaw as it is known locally, as an important resource for their livelihood. Ringal weaving is an age-old craft in Uttarakhand, with almost every family involved directly or indirectly in the regions of Chamoli, Bageshwar, Khalijhuri, Almora, Rudraprayag, Joshimath, and Pithoragarh. Ringal is preferred over bamboo because it is more resistant to water and thus survives longer in the snow-capped Himalayas. Ringal is typically collected from forests between October and November. The artisan weaves dark and light ringal strips to create one-of-a-kind designs. To smooth the edges of the finished product, it is scraped. Some of the natural and eco-friendly products made include kandi/odagi (a large basket used for crop residue and collection), solta/malkhna (a multi-purpose large netted basket), tokari (a round vessel for storing chapati, fruits, flowers, etc.), supa (winnower), changera/bisala/dabolla (dome-shaped basket for storing grains), phooldan, thali, kalam. Ringal products are tough and long-lasting, lasting at least 20 to 25 years. These exquisitely woven products have a wide range of applications. Ringal provides commercial and development opportunities to local communities living in Uttarakhand's hilly terrain who need to generate income for their families during the summer months.
