  <p class="P3">Patachitra painting is a true cultural heritage of West Bengal. The Patua Community of West Bengal has an ancient history to practiced the craft of Patachitra. A quaint little village of Paschim Medinipur, Naya is home to around 250 Patuas or chitrakars. Bengal Patachitra has a various aspect like Chalchitra, Durga Pat, Medinipur Patachitra, kalighat Patachitra, mud wall painting etc. D. P. Ghosh mentioned different style of Bengal Patachitra respecting of the district of West Bengal in his book Folk Art of Bengal.
    </p><br>
    <p>The Patachitra of different districts of West Bengal are characterized by many peculiarities in colour and design. The patachitra of Manbhum, now known as Purulia can easily be distinguished by their preference for one particular shade of burnt sienna relieved by white and yellow patches and densely packed composition. The seated figures of Dasaratha and Chand Sadagar of Medinipur crowning the Ramayana and Kamale-Kamini scrolls are impressive and monumental. In the scrolls of pot of Birbhum, Bankura and Burdwan preference for Indian red background usually found, the scrolls of Hooghly preferred a dark brown. The Hooghly and Manbhum 'pats' are peculiar and definitely modernistic with the abstract linear treatment.</p>
